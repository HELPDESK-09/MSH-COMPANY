The REFLECTIONCOIN coin project aims to support reclaimers, help with connection,
between collectors and recycling companies, turning this part into one of the connection points,
this will increase the amount paid to the collectors, while making a profit for one more guy, who would be the intermediary,
which, in turn, would also gain by making the buy and sell connection,
but it would also decrease the amounts to be paid by recycling companies, making the process faster, more robust and profitable
for everyone, in addition to having another advantage, purchases made in the currency can value along with the market value of the currency.
That is, instead of the buyer paying in Fiat currency, he pays in REFLECTIONCOINS, the seller has the option to change immediately, in 
Exchange, and use the money, leave it on the site in savings, leave it on the site in STAKING, or trade in the market.
To encourage the use of sales made using the REFLECTION COIN currency, there is a 5% gain in currencies on the sale value.
And purchases using the REFLECTIONCOIN currency, have 5% discount on the value in coins.
I'm starting my project, without programming knowledge, in any language,
but I would like to be able to see this project taking shape,
through the hands of programmers willing to help me, each one will have their name and credit for their contribution.
The first part of the project, is very simple and basically consists of creating a panel,
Where, the user will create his account, and buy his coins, to activate his control panel of his REFLECTIONCOINS coins, 
and if desired, start mining by STAKING, and also activation of flexible savings.
In the case of savings, he can leave his coins yielding an amount in % and can withdraw 
your coins whenever you want!
In the case of choosing STAKING, he must leave the coins idle for at least 30 days, choosing,
between 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days, and then reaching the limit, renew for as many days as you want.
And on the back office screen, it should contain the real-time updated information on the currency value, an exchange chart
(Which needs to be inserted directly from the exchange through one there).
And it will also need to have the possibility, the user, to be able to visualize the graph of the currency he/she wants.
( The most suitable API would be trade views or coinmarket ).
And mainly the time and gains counter, which would show, the elapsed time, and the approximate gain, by the elapsed time!
And a menu, with the commands of home, activate/deactivate savings, activate/deactivate STAKING, buy/sell coins,
a button for donation, (The coin project will donate 10% of the monthly profit, to institutions fighting childhood cancer,
and will also encourage coin users to donate as well )

SORRY for the long text, I'm still learning, everything is new for me!!!
